# firsts-projects
This repository will be used to train and understand how git/github works and I will use the Python language in all projects. 

I hope that I can evolve a lot in terms of using tools like these, and every day for a month I will try to carry out a simple/medium project, until I see my abilities to carry out advanced projects!
